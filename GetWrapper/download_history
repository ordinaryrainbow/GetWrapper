Les Apaches|radio|1372767154|flashaaclow1|C:\Users\Public\Documents\common\Composer_of_the_Week_-_Ravel_and_His_World_1._Les_Apaches_b033bsdg_default.m4a|default|3600|For the first time in the long-running history of Composer of the Week, Donald Macleod explores Ravel's life and music in the context of his friends in the artistic group, "Les Apaches".  Ravel's music will be threaded through the week, alongside works by fellow Apaches, Maurice Delage, Déodat de Séverac, Florent Schmitt, Paul Ladmirault and Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht. Among the music featured, there are some rarely heard gems, performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and the BBC Singers.   Donald Macleod begins by looking at the early days of "Les Apaches" in the company of Jann Pasler, Professor of Music at the University of California. Ravel's set of piano pieces "Miroirs" bears dedications to five members of the group, while Delage references the painter Paul Sordes, who provided the studio where the first meetings took place. Déodat de Séverac's music evokes the sunny landscape of the Languedoc, and there's a rare opportunity to hear works by Paul Ladmirault and by D.E Inghelbrecht, in recordings made specially for Composer of the Week by the BBC Singers and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.  At the turn of the twentieth century, Paris was populated by a multitude of composers, painters, writers and poets. When he was in his mid-twenties, Ravel became part of an informal group of artists involved in a range of different specialisms. Active in the years running up to the first world war, the numbers fluctuated, with anything up to twenty-five members. Around the time that the Ballets Russes was taking Paris by storm, Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla also joined the group.  The earlier musical members of "Les Apaches" were similar in age; indeed many of them had met while studying at the Paris Conservatory. They included Ravel, and his childhood friend, the Spanish pianist Ricardo Viñes, who gave first performances of many works by Apache members. We'll also be hearing from Maurice Delage, a life-long friend of Ravel, who's probably best known to us as the composer of Four Hindu Poems, the exotically named minor aristocrat Déodat de Séverac whose music is infused with the light and character of his roots in Southern France, major chamber and orchestral pieces by Prix de Rome winner Florent Schmitt, songs and an orchestral piece much admired by Debussy from the Breton Paul Ladmirault and some rarely heard orchestral works by Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht. Better known as a conductor, Inghelbrecht was an acclaimed interpreter of Debussy, holding a series of important musical directorships before he formed the Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française in 1934.  Admirers of Debussy and Russian music in particular, the Apaches took to meeting up once a week to hear each other's music and poetry, toss around ideas and share their views on the prevailing artistic currents. A group formed casually through friendship is often difficult to detail but in this case several Apache members left accounts. Dipping into these sources, Donald Macleod explores Ravel as he was remembered by his friends, in particular Ricardo Viñes, the poets Léon-Paul Fargue and Tristan Klingsor (Léon Leclère) and the writer and critic Michel Dmitri Calvocoressi. He'll also be talking to Jann Pasler, from the University of California, San Diego, the author of several studies on the Apaches. They'll be fitting the musical jigsaw together, illustrating how different professional activities were mutually beneficial to Apache members and evaluating the group's significance and legacy.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b033bsdg_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b033bsdg.html|1|1|

If life were straightforward he'd be marooned on the island because of his achievements as an Olympic rower. But his early promise on the water was scuppered by a bout of glandular fever - so he's had to make do instead with life as a worldwide entertainment superstar.  Very British comedy, very big budget movies, very successful syndicated TV drama - his 30 year career has taken him from A Little Bit of Fry & Laurie to a big bit of broadcasting history: his role in the U.S. show House ran for 8 series and had a global audience of 81 million. So why now does he feel the need to risk his stellar reputation by making music too?   He says, "as soon as I acknowledge to myself that something is frightening and carries the risk of public humiliation I feel like I have to do it."

An author and Harvard professor he's been named by Time Magazine as one of the world's 100 most influential scientists and thinkers.  The psychology of violence and where language comes from are just two of his specialist subjects. Bill Gates is officially a fan, the man who sends him hate mail related to his work on irregular verbs is not. It would seem that whenever he publishes yet another best-selling book controversy is never far behind - his recent contention that we live in an "unusually peaceful time" drew opprobrium from many quarters.  Born and brought up in Montreal his parents encouraged vigorous debate around the dinner table - indeed it was his mother's interest in the psychology of language and linguistics that sparked his own.   He says "I appreciate what my parents did for me beyond words. Not in making me what I am, but in my view of what's important in life, what I think about and cherish."

Today's theme is Dickens' troubled childhood.  As part of Dickens on the BBC Radio 4 broadcasts extracts from Claire Tomalin's acclaimed new biography of the novelist who called himself the "inimitable". He was the writer "so charged with imaginative energy that he rendered nineteenth century England crackling, full of truth and life, with his laughter, horror and indignation - and sentimentality." The Artful Dodger, Mr Pickwick, Pip and David Copperfield are just a handful of the characters he created and who continue to endure. He was also a hard-working journalist, a philanthropist, a supporter of liberal social causes, and father of ten, and yet his genius also had a dark side which emerged with the break down of his marriage.  Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the The New Statesman and then the Sunday Times before becoming a full time writer. Her biographies are award winning. The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft, won the Whitbread First Book Award, and Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self was Whitbread Book of the Year in 2002.

Barney hates everything about his life. Everything, but his dog. His dog doesn't care that he's an awkward loser. That he's 36, single and broke. That he sweats when he's nervous. That he's been stuck in the same job for seven years and three months and still doesn't know how to work the cappuccino machine. That he's scared of his pubescent boss, and lusts after a girl who doesn't know he exists. So when his dog is run over, Barney realises he's got nothing left to lose, but then a motivational talk from his boss is the beginning of a series of apparently life-changing events.  Bafta award winning Daniel Rigby stars as Barney and Oona Chaplin (The Hour) as Carla.

Directed by Tracey Neale   The Story:  On the eve of her 40th birthday Kate keeps a vigil at the hospital bedside of her mother Maisie. Although Maisie treated her badly as a child, favouring her younger sister Sarah, it is Kate who is seeing her through this last illness.  While searching Maisie's linen cupboard for another nightdress, Kate is shocked to find a box containing a pair of red shoes. They were the beautiful shoes Kate was given for her sixth birthday but her "happiness soon cracked across" when her mother took the shoes away from her in a burst of anger because Kate had come back from the shops with scuffed shoes. The opening of the shoebox triggers childhood memories for Kate and she is determined to confront her mother with the red shoes that have been hidden away for thirty-four years.  When Sarah finally arrives back from America, too late to say her goodbye to her mother, she is full of remorse for not having being around more. Kate tells her that she let Maisie believe she was Sarah and so allowed Maisie to die content believing "her little angel" had returned in time. The sisters talk of the past and Sarah tells Kate how hard it was to be the favourite and see her sister suffer at their Mother's hands. The air is cleared and when Kate tells Sarah she is pregnant her sister is overjoyed. As one life has ebbed away another has begun to grow and Kate finds herself able to forgive Maisie and let the past go too.   The Writer:  Pat Davis has written another beautiful play in BIRTHDAY SHOES. This story is told with poignancy, humour and shows how complex relationships can be healed through forgiveness. Pat has had seven plays broadcast on Radio Four, five on RTE and her play SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE was awarded a Sony Silver in 2002. She has also had two stage plays performed at the King's Head.|BBC Radio 4|Drama|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b02ynfq9_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02ynfq9.html|||

Today's theme is Dickens' troubled childhood.  As part of Dickens on the BBC Radio 4 broadcasts extracts from Claire Tomalin's acclaimed new biography of the novelist who called himself the "inimitable". He was the writer "so charged with imaginative energy that he rendered nineteenth century England crackling, full of truth and life, with his laughter, horror and indignation - and sentimentality." The Artful Dodger, Mr Pickwick, Pip and David Copperfield are just a handful of the characters he created and who continue to endure. He was also a hard-working journalist, a philanthropist, a supporter of liberal social causes, and father of ten, and yet his genius also had a dark side which emerged with the break down of his marriage.  Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the The New Statesman and then the Sunday Times before becoming a full time writer. Her biographies are award winning. The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft, won the Whitbread First Book Award, and Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self was Whitbread Book of the Year in 2002.

Directed by Jessica Dromgoole & Sasha Yevtushenko Sound design by Colin Guthrie  Production co-ordinator: Phil Hawkins Studio managers: Martha Littlehailes, Anne Bunting, Alison Craig  Notes Queen Mary From her earliest years Mary was at the centre of a power struggle: as a child queen, with contending regents; then on her own behalf, balancing powerful men - the King of France, Darnley and Bothwell - against each other and using her own considerable powers to ensure her survival; then against her own countrymen, determined to bring her down and finally, with her cousin Elizabeth of England, this last a desperate and doomed fight for life itself and the survival of her line. There is not a single British monarch whose life was so dramatic, bringing together dynastic struggles, love and murder, the shadowy world of the spy and the lethal jealousy of cousins.  The Stuarts Shakespeare and Marlow were born three years before James VI of Scotland and I of England. Three years before Queen Anne died, Thomas Newcomen created a piston driven steam engine.  The age of the Stuarts is the age in which Britain entered the modern world. Within the brief historical span of its 111 years, the nation experienced virtually all the excitements and alarms we recognise in our own times, from financial meltdown to foreign wars; from the growth of parliamentary democracy to uprisings of the popular will; from the splendours of Catholic ritual to the rigours of religious fundamentalism; from a strict patriarchal society to the first, faint beginnings of female emancipation; from the domination of the stage to the birth of the novel and from a renaissance way of thought to the creation of scientific method and the first stirrings of psychology.|BBC Radio 4|Drama,Historical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b0366wn3_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0366wn3.html|||

James I & VI. Charting the life and reign of the loneliest boy in the world, through his relationships, with his one love, Esme, his bullying tutor, Buchanan, his charming Queen, Anne, to his favourite, George Villiers.  Directed by Jessica Dromgoole & Sasha Yevtushenko Sound design by Colin Guthrie  Production co-ordinator: Phil Hawkins Studio managers: Martha Littlehailes, Anne Bunting, Alison Craig  Notes  Becoming King of England does not free James from the prison of his past or his nature; on the other hand it does allow him a vastly broader canvas on which both his virtues and his faults show clearly. He seeks to vindicate his mother's memory and attacks those who attacked her; he encourages learning and discourages foreign adventures, he supports brilliant men and women but, when convenient, or when bullied, allows them to be destroyed. At his death, will he leave as difficult an inheritance to his son as his mother did to him?|BBC Radio 4|Drama,Historical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b0367c3b_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0367c3b.html|||

Today's theme is Dickens' troubled childhood.  As part of Dickens on the BBC Radio 4 broadcasts extracts from Claire Tomalin's acclaimed new biography of the novelist who called himself the "inimitable". He was the writer "so charged with imaginative energy that he rendered nineteenth century England crackling, full of truth and life, with his laughter, horror and indignation - and sentimentality." The Artful Dodger, Mr Pickwick, Pip and David Copperfield are just a handful of the characters he created and who continue to endure. He was also a hard-working journalist, a philanthropist, a supporter of liberal social causes, and father of ten, and yet his genius also had a dark side which emerged with the break down of his marriage.  Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the The New Statesman and then the Sunday Times before becoming a full time writer. Her biographies are award winning. The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft, won the Whitbread First Book Award, and Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self was Whitbread Book of the Year in 2002.

Yoshida and introduced by David Mitchell Read by Kasper Hilton-Hille   Thirteen year old Naoki Higashida explores how he experiences the world as a child with autism. He describes how going for a walk can melt him into nature and out of time, his feeling that the touch of another person might make his thoughts visible, and the pleasure of numbers and lines. Most movingly, he explains that because he struggles to have a conversation with another person, he can find himself desperately lonely and aching for company.  When novelist David Mitchell, whose own son has autism, discovered this extraordinary book, he felt that for the first time his own son was talking to him about what was going on inside his head, through the words of the young author.

Yoshida and introduced by David Mitchell Read by Kasper Hilton-Hille   Thirteen year old Naoki Higashida invites us into his world, an intimate astonishing insight into the perceptions and feelings of a child with autism. He explains his simple delight in spinning objects, and his own pleasure in movement, which is deeply calming for him and stems from a feeling that in stillness his very soul might detach itself from his body.  Naoki's autism is so severe that he finds it difficult to hold a conversation, and he wrote the book painstakingly, using an 'Alphabet Grid', Japanese character by character. His writing reveals a young teenager sensitive to the feelings and perceptions of others but often isolated from those he loves.  When the author David Mitchell, whose own son has autism, discovered this extraordinary book, he felt that for the first time his own son was talking to him about what was going on inside his head, through the words of the young author.

Broken-hearted and rootless after losing her whisky company in the 2011 tsunami, a Japanese businesswoman arrives on the Scottish island of Islay in search of the perfect dram of whisky. Following in the footsteps of her great-grandfather (who had visited the island in 1910 to learn the secrets of whisky distilling and returned to Japan with a Scottish wife) she hopes to find solace by returning to her Scottish roots.  Iain Finlay MacLeod is a Scottish playwright who has written for theatre, radio and television. He is a native Gaelic speaker from the Outer Hebrides and is fascinated by questions of home and exile, language and identity.  "Sakura's Tune" is composed by Angus Lyon and the accordionist is Colin Train.

Sarah has been cycling for two hours. Where's she going? And why? She's determined to see the husband who deserted her. She has heard he is lying ill at Ebesham.   Three years ago he had come into some money and it had turned his head. Then the farm seemed too small for him. He went to look at bigger farms miles away. On one of his journeys he met an attractive widow. One day they left quietly together, and later Sarah heard that they had set up house at Ebesham. And now Sarah is riding there, where David is lying ill. But she arrives to find an unexpected situation. What she does next could probably only have come from Malachi Whitaker compassionate pen.   Malachi Whitaker was prolific in the 1920s and '30s, writing with great perception and care about ordinary folk, invariably setting the stories in her native Yorkshire. She became known as 'the Chekhov of the north' because of her sympathetic observation of the minutiae of human beings and their (often comic) behaviour.

The first two acts were broadcast in yesterday's programme. At the end of Act II Poro's wife Cleofide was incorrectly told of her husband's death. Act III begins as Poro meets with his sister Eissena and swears revenge on Alexander.  Then you can hear the second part of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra's recent concert in Rotterdam (the first half was in Wednesday's programme): two pieces about the transition from Winter to Spring by two British composers, Benjamin Britten and his favourite teacher Frank Bridge.  Bridge's orchestral rhapsody Enter Spring is full of bird-song and the sounds of the coming spring on the blustery Sussex Downs. Britten's Spring Symphony is, according to the composer, 'a symphony not only dealing with the Spring itself but with the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means'.  Oliver Knussen met and was encouraged by Britten when he was young. Today we hear his Choral, written in the early '70s and completed when he was 20. The piece is written for a wind band split into various discrete choirs which play slow funeral processions counter to each other before accelerating and finally converging. This performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra was conducted by the composer as part of his Total Immersion Barbican event last November.  Oliver Knussen has conducted and championed works by the composer who rounds off Afternoon on 3's focus on British Symphonies, Julian Anderson. His Symphony was written in 2003 when he was Composer-in-Association to the CBSO. It was influenced, in part, by Finnish artist Axel Gallen's Morning by a Lake, which is set in spring and depicts a lake, half-covered in ice, gradually melting.

The Forbidden is a chilling, urban horror dramatised for radio by Duncan MacMillan. It's adapted from Clive Barker's original novella, first published in 1985 and the inspiration for the cult 1992 horror film, Candyman.  The film was set in America, but the original short story was located in Britain, on a dilapidated council estate. This radio dramatisation takes it back to its roots: the story has been modernised, but set in a post-riot Britain, where materialism and greed are increasingly prevalent in all spheres of society.  Helen and her husband Trevor have recently moved into a gated community in the area where she originally grew up. She is becoming more and more disturbed by a nightmare, where she finds herself in a basement on her old estate and knows someone else is there. But who? And what do they want from her?   As Helen insists on exploring the old estate, meeting an old friend and encountering mysterious, frightened teenagers, her home life is affected badly. As she grows increasingly suspicious that Trevor is being unfaithful, she returns to the basement which now haunts her sleep. What she discovers there is both a horrific shock and a sense of coming home, at last.  Recorded on location in London, with an original score from composer John Coxon (Spring Heel Jack, Spiritualized).  Music composed by John Coxon, recorded and mixed by Rupert Clervaux and John Coxon. Sound design by Eloise Whitmore.

His journey takes him to Skye on the trail of Flora Macdonald where he attempts to solve the seeming conundrum of how Scotland's most famous Jacobite heroine could have become a loyal subject of the Hanoverian British state in later life. He asks whether the concept of national identity we have today would hold true for a Scot living through the wars of the 18th/early 19th century, and he explores the role the Scots played in inventing 'Britishness'. But was there also a dark side to all this - profiting in the miseries caused by empire?|BBC Radio Scotland|Factual,History,Scotland|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b0367c46_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0367c46.html|1|1|

Formed out of the punk and political activist scenes in late seventies London, the band burned brightly for two years at the end of the decade. Tom and Johnnie will cover how the band formed, the vitality of songs like Glad To Be Gay for the gay rights movement, and how important the small ads were for getting anything done as a musician.

It's 1959, and Rumpole is faced with defending a clergyman accused of shoplifting who although he clearly did not commit the crime, is curiously reluctant to be cross examined under oath, where he would have to tell the truth, but save himself from being defrocked.  Meanwhile Rumpole's fellow barrister and friend Frobisher, a confirmed bachelor, announces his engagement to a very merry widow, whom Rumpole seems to remember he has met somewhere before...  And finally, Hilda, she who must be obeyed, drops a bomb of information which will have a profound effect on their marriage.

Today's theme is Dickens' troubled childhood.  As part of Dickens on the BBC Radio 4 broadcasts extracts from Claire Tomalin's acclaimed new biography of the novelist who called himself the "inimitable". He was the writer "so charged with imaginative energy that he rendered nineteenth century England crackling, full of truth and life, with his laughter, horror and indignation - and sentimentality." The Artful Dodger, Mr Pickwick, Pip and David Copperfield are just a handful of the characters he created and who continue to endure. He was also a hard-working journalist, a philanthropist, a supporter of liberal social causes, and father of ten, and yet his genius also had a dark side which emerged with the break down of his marriage.  Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the The New Statesman and then the Sunday Times before becoming a full time writer. Her biographies are award winning. The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft, won the Whitbread First Book Award, and Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self was Whitbread Book of the Year in 2002.

He seeks to vindicate his mother's memory and attacks those who attacked her; he encourages learning and discourages foreign adventures, he supports brilliant men and women but, when convenient, or when bullied, allows them to be destroyed.

His waspish and witty diaries, which have inspired these three linked plays, chart the decline and fall of the English country house. It's 1942 and Lees-Milne is billeted with the National Trust at West Wycombe Park - a world away from Blitz-ridden London. Lees-Milne is a rising star of the Trust. Invalided out of the army, he's looking for his own battles to fight and is determined to save the house and preserve it for the nation. But times are hard and the Trust is reliant on a considerable endowment before they can acquire a property - an endowment which the incumbent inhabitants, Johnnie and Helen Dashwood, can ill-afford to pay. Helen is an imperious host, but is desperate for paying guests - so when Nancy Mitford comes to stay, she's welcomed with open arms. Lees-Milne is delighted for the distraction, but it's difficult for guests to throw themselves into the house party spirit in sub-zero conditions. Fortunately, Nancy is obsessed with the Antarctic explorers and Captain Scott, even nicknaming the upstairs lavatory 'The Beardmore' (after the glacier of the same name), much to Helen's chagrin. But it's a brittle peace, as cloistered together, all the guests attempt to block out the war for as long as possible.  Produced & directed by Marion Nancarrow  The three plays star Tobias Menzies (Rome; Game of Thrones ) as James Lees-Milne and Victoria Hamilton (Lark Rise to Candleford; Victoria & Albert) as the novelist Nancy Mitford and chart four years during the war when Lees-Milne was at his most industrious, trying to save properties for the National Trust. In this first play, Samuel Barnett (The History Boys; Twenty Twelve) makes a guest appearance as Cecil Beaton.|BBC Radio 4|Factual,Life Stories,Drama|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b036k3sc_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036k3sc.html|1|1|

Although Boccherini was originally born in the Tuscan city of Lucca, he spent the majority of his life as a working musician in Spain, after a brief spell in Paris. His extensive output is largely now forgotten, but one work in particular, the Minuet from his fifth String Quartet opus 11, is one of the most used entry points by film and TV producers today, creating a sense of eighteenth century elegance and period. Boccherini is also credited with forming the first ever string quartet, yet despite his popularity during much of his lifetime, Boccherini lived at the end of his life in virtual poverty, seeing his wife and daughters die one after another, before his own death possibly from tuberculosis.  Luigi Boccherini came from a humble background, with his father performing as a double bassist in their home city of Lucca. Luigi quickly made a name for himself not only as a cellist, but also as a composer for the cello, including works such as his sixth Cello Sonata, in C major. The young Luigi was soon sent off to Rome for further musical training, where he came into contact with much of the sacred choral music taking place there. Boccherini would go on to compose many sacred choral works of his own, such as the Kyrie in B flat, from his own setting of the Mass.  Boccherini junior was now making quite a name for himself as a virtuoso player of the cello, and along with his father, embarked on a tour performing in Venice, Trieste and Vienna. By the time of their second engagement in Vienna, Boccherini was composing and publishing his first significant works, which caused quite a stir. His first set of trios made a huge impression on the older composer Gluck. His published opus 2 quartets also had a huge impact, including the fifth String Quartet in E major.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b01cvp2v_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cvp2v.html|1|1|

For when he was seven, the South African Opal miner who lodged at his parents' house committed suicide, an act which triggers an unusual chain of events and awakens something ancient - ancient and dangerous. Something from beyond this world has found its way into our world and is threatening to destroy not only the young boy's family, but his life. Befriended by Lettie Hempstock, her mother, and grandmother, they must try to send the creature home, but doing so involves terrifying forces which endangers their lives and the very fabric of the world itself. However perhaps most mysterious of all is Lettie Hempstock's curious insistence that the duck pond at the end of the lane is really an ocean.  A novel about memory, about the adventures, experiences and enchantment of childhood and the power of stories, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is Neil Gaiman's highly anticipated first adult novel in eight years. Gaiman is the acclaimed and award-winning author of the novels American Gods, Stardust, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere, Coraline, and The Graveyard Book. His work has been adapted for film, television, and radio, including Stardust (2007) and the BAFTA-winning and Oscar-nominated animated feature film Coraline (2009), while Neverwhere which began life as a BBC TV series has recently been adapted for Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra.

Boccherini on tour with his father in Vienna, was soon longing to return for his native city of Lucca. However upon their return, Luigi was soon disillusioned and wished to leave again, wanting to pursue his musical career elsewhere. Still keeping his contractual ties with Lucca, Boccherini toured Pavia and Cremona with his father. It was around this time that he composed his successful opus two set of quartets, including the second String Quartet in B flat major.  Back in Lucca, Boccherini had certain obligations to the city fathers there, and was commissioned to compose for various civic occasions, along with his contractual arrangements to regularly perform. One work Boccherini composed during this period, which may have been commissioned by his city employers, was his oratorio Gioas, or King of Judah.  Soon afterwards, Boccherini's father died. Young Luigi accompanied by his friend Manfredi, was able to spread his wings without his family in tow, and they made their way to Paris. This was good timing, as some of Boccherini's works had just been published there. It was during this period in Paris when Boccherini relied upon the patronage of Baron de Bagge, that through this aristocrats music library, Boccherini was likely to have come into contact with the ideas of orchestral woodwind writing.

Comfortably accommodated in a flat in Cheyne Walk, Lees-Milne is attempting to secure a nearby property to house the musical collection of Boer War veteran, Major Benton Fletcher. Late one night, whilst trying to telephone a friend, Lees-Milne has a crossed line and makes the acquaintance of an anonymous woman. A friendship grows over the telephone wires, but at the woman's insistence they both keep their identities secret. When Lees-Milnes's childhood friend Tom Mitford returns unexpectedly from the continent, a sexual attraction is reawakened. Tom, however, has been a committed red-blooded male since Eton and is now determined to settle down after the war and raise a family - expecting James to help him sift through a list of potential wives. Tom is now a realist in love, but Lees-Milne is still an idealist. When disaster strikes, Lees-Milne is rely on the mysterious woman at the end of the telephone more than ever before.

Faringdon is home to the composer, artist and poet Gerald, Lord Berners, who has returned to England under a cloud, having spent most of the war in Rome. Lord Berners is an eccentric through-and-through - a man given to dying his doves to co-ordinate with the food he's serving and the once proud owner of a pet giraffe. Together with the handsome Robert Heber Percy and his wife, Jennifer, Lord Berners is part of an apparently successful ménage a trois. Lees-Milne finds it an inspirational relationship and is convinced it would be the perfect and most civilised lifestyle to lead. Berners is determined that provision must be made for his beloved Robert if the house is acquired by the Trust. And as Lees-Milne contemplates mortality, he considers what his own legacy will be.

Whilst in Paris, Boccherini was approached by the Spanish Ambassador, who proposed that Boccherini and his friend the violinist Manfredi, might like to visit Madrid, and that the two young men would receive a rapturous welcome from the heir to the Spanish throne. Both Boccherini and Manfredi travelled to Spain, but their welcome was not what they had hoped it would be. In a bid to ingratiate himself with the Spanish Prince, Boccherini dedicated his Opus 6 trios to him, including the fifth Trio in G minor. This didn't get the Prince's attention.  Another Royal patron did however materialise, and this was the King's brother, Don Luis, whom Boccherini would go on to work for, for many years. Boccherini would compose many works dedicated to his royal patron, including sextets, quintets, and a set of symphonies, which included the third Symphony in C major opus 12. These works steadily began to establish Boccherini's reputation in Spain and further afield, in particular his set of quintets opus 11. The sixth of this set, nicknamed The Aviary, depicts Boccherini's patron's passion for exotic birds.  Don Luis would soon fall out of favour with his family and the royal court, over his marriage to a lady of non-royal blood. This soon meant that Don Luis's court would have to move far from Madrid.

Faringdon is home to the composer, artist and poet Gerald, Lord Berners, who has returned to England under a cloud, having spent most of the war in Rome. Lord Berners is an eccentric through-and-through - a man given to dying his doves to co-ordinate with the food he's serving and the once proud owner of a pet giraffe. Together with the handsome Robert Heber Percy and his wife, Jennifer, Lord Berners is part of an apparently successful ménage a trois. Lees-Milne finds it an inspirational relationship and is convinced it would be the perfect and most civilised lifestyle to lead. Berners is determined that provision must be made for his beloved Robert if the house is acquired by the Trust. And as Lees-Milne contemplates mortality, he considers what his own legacy will be.  Produced & directed by Marion Nancarrow  The three plays star Tobias Menzies (Rome; Game of Thrones ) as James Lees-Milne and Victoria Hamilton (Lark Rise to Candleford; Victoria & Albert) as the novelist Nancy Mitford and chart four years during the war when Lees-Milne was at his most industrious in trying to secure properties for the National Trust. In this play, Christopher Godwin (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; My Family & Other Animals) stars as the eccentric Gerald, Lord Berners.|BBC Radio 4|Factual,Life Stories,Drama|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b036kscx_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036kscx.html|3|1|

In 1953 Henry underwent an experimental brain operation to alleviate his debilitating epilepsy which had a devastating and unexpected side effect. Henry was unable to store or recall any new memories, no longer could he remember the faces of new people he met, the places he visited, the moments he lived through, and the myriad experiences of everyday life. Memories slipped from him after just thirty seconds. Following the medical procedure he became the subject of research into neuroscience and went on to transform the way the scientific community understand memory and how it functions. This book is both a biography of Henry (known in the media and the world of science as HM), and the development of neuroscience over the course of the fifty years from the date of Henry's operation to his death in 2008.  Permanent Present Tense is written by the renowned neuroscientist Suzanne Corkin who is the head of the Corkin Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She worked with Henry for nearly five decades and tells his story and that of his contribution to medical science and elucidates the complex world of memory and the advances that have been made by researchers and enhanced by the technological revolution of the last half century.|BBC Radio 4|Factual,Life Stories|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b036tsnh_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036tsnh.html|1|1|

When idealistic young volunteer Julie sets off for Nigeria, she's a bundle of nerves. Her project is to teach sewing skills to women in a refuge in Jos; but what if they don't like her - or feel patronised by her attempts to teach them?  Once Julie's in Jos, her anxieties evaporate. Sewing class is a roaring success, and Julie's only problems are the stupid caution and lack of enthusiasm of refuge director Fran, and the incomprehensible tensions surrounding the silent Muslim woman, Mathenneh.   Inspired by a plan to help the women make money from their sewing, ready to really make a difference to their lives, Julie is on a roll ... blithely unaware that there may be consequences, unimaginable and terrible, to her failure to play by Fran's rules.

In 1944 the two men came together to work on a screen adaptation of James M Cain's novel Double Indemnity. Billy Wilder is a 36 year old German Jewish émigré just making his name as a director and Raymond Chandler is a reformed alcoholic with a developing reputation as a novelist but absolutely no experience of writing for movies. The play follows their famously difficult collaboration. Directed by Claire Grove  Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler are legendary. The English-educated, middle-aged , would-be intellectual versus the ambitious young German émigré. Paramount Studios put Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder together because none of the big names would touch James M Cain's novel. With its adulterous lovers, and a crime that could be copied, it was judged too controversial to adapt because of the censorious Production Code guidelines. Chandler and Wilder famously hated each other but in a space of some four months locked in an office together they created an outstanding screenplay for a ground-breaking classic film .|BBC Radio 4|Drama|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b00y2xn6_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00y2xn6.html|||

Originally broadcast in Holy Week, The People's Passion explores how our great cathedrals offer an image of the contradictions of faith in twenty-first century Britain.  The People's Passion Mass and Easter Anthem, composed specially for the series by Sasha Johnson Manning, with lyrics written by the poet Michael Symmons Roberts, not only features in the programmes, but was made freely available by the BBC, and sung by a hundred and fifty choirs around Britain and across the world, during Easter 2012, including Easter Day Worship on Radio 4, from Manchester Cathedral.  1/5: Coming to Jerusalem  by Nick Warburton  Monday morning in Holy Week.

Starring Alistair McGowan as Erik Satie, Nathaniel Parker as Claude Debussy, Imogen Stubbs as Suzanne Valadon and Charlotte Page as Paulette Darty.   Satie is now most famous for his delicate and dreamlike 'Gymnopedies', but he was a man ahead of his time - turning his back on the musical conventions of his day and composing spare, 'white' pieces with strange titles, such as 'Flabby Preludes for a Dog' and 'Three Pieces in the Shape of a Pear'  But he was also a complex and solitary man. McGowan's drama looks at three key figures in Satie's life - his friend and rival, Claude Debussy; his first love, the artist Suzanne Valadon and the society soprano, Paulette Darty, for whom he nurtured a long, but undeclared, devotion.  But despite the poignancy of Satie's romantic life, this is a fresh and funny portrayal of an engagingly eccentric figure - a man who saved time deciding what to wear by buying seven, identical, yellow, corduroy suits (one for every day of the week) and who, for a time, consumed only white foods in the hope of instilling that simplicity and purity into his own body and music.

Or were they? As part of the BBC's Piano Season, Donald Macleod hunts out the countless intersections of their lives as they both forge their careers in the face of revolution, war and cultural exile.   It's hardly surprising that the two are remembered so differently. Whereas Rachmaninov saw out his last years in luxury, expensive cars parked outside his Beverly Hills mansion, Medtner ended his days in a non-descript semi in North London. Rachmaninov had been a musical entrepreneur, willing to follow the market, whereas Medtner had a reputation for intellectualism and stubbornness. Only Medtner would have put his musical philosophy into book form, and yet 'The Muse and the Fashion' was so impenetrable that it instantly disappeared into publishing oblivion.   But on countless occasions the musicians' careers brought them together. Rachmaninov's help and advice proved invaluable as Medtner built his early career as both pianist and composer, and the pair later formed a united front against what they saw as the destruction of Russian music. And with Rachmaninov's guidance, the anxious Medtner, who didn't speak a word of English, was able to build a lucrative concert career in Europe and the US.   During the week, we hear the two concertos which the composers dedicated to each other, and also some of the recordings which they left of their own playing, including previously unbroadcast piano roll transcriptions. And to begin, Donald Macleod pinpoints the composers' early encounters, both of them graduating from the Moscow Conservatoire. But whereas Rachmaninov leaves as a confident young artist, Medtner suffers a near-disastrous early blow to his confidence.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b01ngp50_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ngp50.html|1|1|

This is Europe in 1913 - the year before the storm. Florian Illies captures a world on the edge of a cataclysm, in which armies are enlarged and and nationalistic lines are drawn.

Tchaikovsky played a crucial role in the creation of a new, national musical tradition in his homeland; eventually becoming Russia's greatest musical export and one of the most popular composers of the Romantic era.  Despite his obvious musical talents, Tchaikovsky decided to pursue a career in law. In this first programme, Donald Macleod tells how the young government clerk eventually overcame his doubts and became a student at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Donald then follows him to Moscow, where Tchaikovsky took on a new teaching job and his first significant love affair.

Originally broadcast in Holy Week, The People's Passion explores how our great cathedrals offer an image of the contradictions of faith in twenty-first century Britain.  The People's Passion Mass and Easter Anthem, composed specially for the series by Sasha Johnson Manning, with lyrics written by the poet Michael Symmons Roberts, not only features in the programmes, but was made freely available by the BBC, and sung by a hundred and fifty choirs around Britain and across the world, during Easter 2012, including Easter Day Worship on Radio 4, from Manchester Cathedral.  2/5: Betrayal  by Nick Warburton   Callum has no job and nothing to fill his days, but he loves to sing in the Cathedral's Voluntary choir. With the choir, he is rehearsing the newly commissioned Easter Anthem, to perform on Good Friday. Who would dream of stopping him? But temptation can whisper in all sorts of ears...  Produced and Directed by Jonquil Panting   Original music by Sasha Johnson Manning, with lyrics by Michael Symmons Roberts.

Perhaps, there is a more exciting and wealthy husband she might be able to catch ...  Anthony Trollope..........Robert Glenister Arabella Trefoil.............Anna Maxwell Martin Lady Augustus.............Barbara Flynn John Morton.................Blake Ritson Senator Gotobed..........Stuart Milligan Reginald Morton...........Daniel Rabin Mrs Morton..................Richenda Carey Mary Masters...............Penelope Rawlins Lawrence Twentyman...Carl Prekopp Lord Rufford.................Henry Devas Mr Bearside.................Sean Baker  Directed by Tracey Neale  The Story: In this little known tale, Anthony Trollope never allows The American Senator's attitude to get in the way of plot -and his ability to weave story strands which arise out of credible motivation, psychology and emotion is as sure as ever. The characters are as finely drawn as we have come to expect from the pen of Trollope. There's the extraordinary Arabella but also the comic, kind natured and the tragic characters too.   Arabella finds herself in the ignoble occupation of husband/fortune-hunting. She's aware that the years are passing and the strain of numerous failed relationships have made her prospects increasingly poor. She is unofficially engaged to John Morton, a diplomat, and owner of a large estate, but now the wealthy and more exciting Lord Rufford has come into view. His estate being larger and more grand. Surely he is worth fighting for?  Arabella, encouraged by her monstrous mother, Lady Augustus, decides to try and keep Morton on the back-burner (but deny her engagement in public) while engineering a series of compromising situations in an outrageous attempt to win Rufford.   But Arabella is playing a dangerous game and although her behaviour is both conniving and ruthless, she is extraordinary and powerfully-drawn and so does not become an out-and-out anti-heroine. She is, to some degree, the victim of her situation - and of her mother. She is courageous as well as devious, and she has her pride. As the tale concludes and she seeks some degree of redemption she achieves tragic status.   A parallel but secondary plot concerns Reginald Morton, an elder cousin of John, and Mary Masters, who is the complete antithesis to Miss Trefoil. Mary's absurd, domineering stepmother thinks that Mary should marry a besotted local farmer, Lawrence Twentyman but Mary is in love with Reginald Morton. Is he in love with her though? She finds support in the shape of Reginald's kind and gentle aunt, Lady Ushant, but there is the stern and grim grandmother of both John and Reginald who stands in the way of happiness because of a long-standing family feud.  Elias Gotobed, the visiting senator of the book's title, has little impact on events - but he has an important part to play as an observer of events; a gauche but vigorous critic of the antiquated elements of English society and the establishment. Gotobed's conclusions are a supplement to those which can be drawn from Arabella's tale, where greed, class-consciousness and snobbery are mercilessly displayed.   'The American Senator' is, in part, a state of the nation novel - enhanced by the parallels between Trollope's world and ours. Arabella has her modern-day equivalents, and the Senator's remarks throughout the dramatisation about the working man's passive and subservient nature have not lost their relevance.   The Author: Anthony Trollope produced a vast collection of work about credible people and their foibles. He gained recognition as a writer who portrayed English life is a wry and honest manner with a cast of humorous and delightful characters. His portrayal of female characters is particularly skilful and Arabella Trefoil is no exception.  The Dramatist: Martyn Wade is a skilled and talented radio writer and dramatist. He has dramatised the 'Barsetshire' novels for radio and the 'Palliser' series too. His other Trollope dramatisations have included 'Orley Farm' and 'Miss Mackenzie'.

This is Europe in 1913 - the year before the storm. Florian Illies captures a world on the edge of a cataclysm, in which armies are enlarged and and nationalistic lines are drawn.  But Illies' snapshots are of a Europe, though laden with premonition, that is still vibrant and creative. The Futurists, Fauvists and Expressionists are redefining art; Proust and Joyce are reshaping literature; Freud and Jung are battling their way through the subconscious; Stravinsky has tapped a primative nerve in music; and Einstein is, well, Einstein.  The anecdotes and observations embrace Picasso, Braque, the Mona Lisa (mostly missing), Thomas Mann, Duchamp, Franz Ferdinand, Kirchner, Klee, Klimt, Kandinsky, Kafka, Wedekind, Einstein, King George V, Stalin, Hitler, Redl, Machu Picchu, Münter and many more.  Florian Illies trained as an art historian at Bonn and Oxford. He was editor of FAZ's 'Berliner Seiten' and the arts section of 'Die Ziet', and he co-founded the arts magazine 'Monopol'. He is currently a managing partner at the fine art auction house Villa Grisebach in Berlin. 1913: The Year Before The Storm has so far sold over 200,000 copies in Germany.

It is now time to tell John Morton she no longer wants to marry him?   Anthony Trollope..........Robert Glenister Arabella Trefoil.............Anna Maxwell Martin Lady Augustus.............Barbara Flynn John Morton.................Blake Ritson Senator Gotobed..........Stuart Milligan Lady Ushant................Joanna David Reginald Morton...........Daniel Rabin Mary Masters...............Penelope Rawlins Lawrence Twentyman...Carl Prekopp Lord Rufford.................Henry Devas Duchess of Mayfair.......Elaine Claxton Mounser Green............Joanathan Forbes Mrs. Masters...............Jane Whittenshaw Mr Bearside.................Sean Baker  Directed by Tracey Neale  The Story: In this little known tale, Anthony Trollope never allows The American Senator's attitude to get in the way of plot -and his ability to weave story strands which arise out of credible motivation, psychology and emotion is as sure as ever. The characters are as finely drawn as we have come to expect from the pen of Trollope. There's the extraordinary Arabella but also the comic, kind natured and the tragic characters too.   Arabella finds herself in the ignoble occupation of husband/fortune-hunting. She's aware that the years are passing and the strain of numerous failed relationships have made her prospects increasingly poor. She is unofficially engaged to John Morton, a diplomat, and owner of a large estate, but now the wealthy and more exciting Lord Rufford has come into view. His estate being larger and more grand. Surely he is worth fighting for?  Arabella, encouraged by her monstrous mother, Lady Augustus, decides to try and keep Morton on the back-burner (but deny her engagement in public) while engineering a series of compromising situations in an outrageous attempt to win Rufford.   But Arabella is playing a dangerous game and although her behaviour is both conniving and ruthless, she is extraordinary and powerfully-drawn and so does not become an out-and-out anti-heroine. She is, to some degree, the victim of her situation - and of her mother. She is courageous as well as devious, and she has her pride. As the tale concludes and she seeks some degree of redemption she achieves tragic status.   A parallel but secondary plot concerns Reginald Morton, an elder cousin of John, and Mary Masters, who is the complete antithesis to Miss Trefoil. Mary's absurd, domineering stepmother thinks that Mary should marry a besotted local farmer, Lawrence Twentyman but Mary is in love with Reginald Morton. Is he in love with her though? She finds support in the shape of Reginald's kind and gentle aunt, Lady Ushant, but there is the stern and grim grandmother of both John and Reginald who stands in the way of happiness because of a long-standing family feud.  Elias Gotobed, the visiting senator of the book's title, has little impact on events - but he has an important part to play as an observer of events; a gauche but vigorous critic of the antiquated elements of English society and the establishment. Gotobed's conclusions are a supplement to those which can be drawn from Arabella's tale, where greed, class-consciousness and snobbery are mercilessly displayed.   'The American Senator' is, in part, a state of the nation novel - enhanced by the parallels between Trollope's world and ours. Arabella has her modern-day equivalents, and the Senator's remarks throughout the dramatisation about the working man's passive and subservient nature have not lost their relevance.   The Author: Anthony Trollope produced a vast collection of work about credible people and their foibles. He gained recognition as a writer who portrayed English life is a wry and honest manner with a cast of humorous and delightful characters. His portrayal of female characters is particularly skilful and Arabella Trefoil is no exception.  The Dramatist: Martyn Wade is a skilled and talented radio writer and dramatist. He has dramatised the 'Barsetshire' novels for radio and the 'Palliser' series too. His other Trollope dramatisations have included 'Orley Farm' and 'Miss Mackenzie'. He also dramatised Ada Leverson's 'The Little Ottleys' for Woman's Hour.|BBC Radio 4 Extra|Drama,Classic & Period|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b013rj8z_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013rj8z.html|2|1|

Her professional life has been defined by public service at the very highest level and she appears the epitome of the cool-headed pragmatist. And yet she is also something of an enigma: a committed Catholic who fought hard to legalise contraception and divorce; an elected head of state with both a noble bearing and a common touch.   As a lawyer she lead from the front championing controversial causes at home in Ireland and fiercely defending human rights at the UN. She also has a habit of making history - she was Ireland's first female president and the first Irish Head of state to meet Her Majesty the Queen at Buckingham Palace.  She says of her life and work "over the years I have given many talks and taken part in many discussions on leadership: women's leadership, political leadership, business leadership, grass roots leadership. But the element of leadership that really fascinates me is moral leadership."

It was a volatile relationship in which Ashton, by many years the older partner, had become increasingly insecure, adding to his fairly constant anxieties about maintaining the success of his glittering career, and making enough money to live on.  Over the years, Ashton had become fairly well connected to royalty and was an accustomed visitor to courtly bashes, where his fearless ability to entertain made him welcome. But it was the Queen Mother with whom he established a particular friendship, inspiring Princess Margaret to ask Ashton to commission a new ballet for her mother's 80th birthday. Ashton decided to use the music from Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini, with Leslie Collier and Mikhail Baryshnikov in the principal roles.  Christopher William Hill's poignant comedy, based on these events, imagines Ashton's struggles with a challenging commission and, simultaneously, his increasing difficulties in managing a fragmenting love affair.

In this 70th anniversary week of the programme, Donald Macleod explores the work and life of this prototypically Romantic composer, who drew his inspiration as much from literature and the dramas of his own life as from the music of the composers he revered - above all, Bach, Beethoven and Schubert.  Largely self-taught, Schumann immersed himself in one musical medium until he felt ready to move on and tackle another. So this week's programmes look in turn at his five major fields of compositional activity: solo piano; song; chamber music; music drama; and music for orchestra.  For his first ten years as a composer, Schumann focused almost exclusively on the piano. He was a virtuoso pianist and had originally envisaged a solo career, so it was a natural place for him to start. Schumann's piano music is closely bound up with the circumstances of its creation, from the early Toccata in C, inspired by seeing Paganini in concert, to another C major work on an altogether grander scale, the Fantasie, op.17, which dramatizes the composer's inner life, and particularly his feelings of desolation at being separated from Clara Wieck (later to become his wife). The soberly-titled Variations in E flat major on an Original Theme are Schumann's last surviving work for solo piano, written days before his voluntary committal to the asylum where he would see out his final years. He said that the theme was 'dictated by the angels' whose voices he heard one night as he lay in bed.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b037vywm_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037vywm.html|1|1|

It's 1937 and Stephen Sefton is drifting. Just a year earlier, he'd left London in a fever of idealism to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Now he is back, injured both mentally and physically. He has turned into a seething mass of self- pity. He's at rock bottom and penniless. So when he sees an advert for an assistant to a writer, he applies. His interviewer is the People's Professor; Swanton Morley - whose type of learning is the sort scorned by academia but loved by the masses, who lap up his books with titles like 'Morley's Art for All' and 'Morley's Old Wild West.'  His latest project is to be called The County Guides. It's a typically ambitious plan to celebrate the best of England county by county, from the wheelwrights of Devon to the shoe makers of Northampton, and covering sport, natural history and every other conceivable subject in between. They're starting in Norfolk, but they're going to be distracted by a dark discovery and a host of eccentric characters - not all of whom react well to Morley's manner, his pedigree or his un-flinching quest to reveal the truth.

Luke Howard, often called "the father of meteorology" was a chemist, whose ideas for cloud classification were stirred when he was a schoolboy. In his late twenties he composed the influential 'Essay on the Modification of Clouds', which was delivered at the Askesian Society, a fortnightly London science meeting.  Howard's influence upon art and poetry is as impressive as his meteorological discoveries. His essay became the subject of poems by Goethe and Percy Bysshe Shelley and he is believed to have inspired some of John Constable's landscapes.  Before composing a new poem dedicated to Luke Howard, Lavinia goes cloud spotting in Somerset with Gavin Pretor-Pinney, founder of The Cloud Appreciation Society. Richard Hamblyn, Luke Howard's biographer, describes how he gave the Romantics a new scientific language and Constable expert Anne Lyles examines Luke Howard's impact on the visual arts.

The People's Passion Mass and Easter Anthem, composed specially for the series by Sasha Johnson Manning, with lyrics written by the poet Michael Symmons Roberts, not only features in the programmes, but was made freely available by the BBC, and sung by a hundred and fifty choirs around Britain and across the world, during Easter 2012, including Easter Day Worship on Radio 4, from Manchester Cathedral.  3/5: Last Supper  by Nick Warburton   When Clive, the Cathedral's Vice Dean, invites his girlfriend Jo to tea; and Graham, one of the vergers, is bullied into feeding a troublesome visitor... neither man knows quite what's in store for him.

Today's programme is set largely in 1840, Schumann's 'year of song'. It was an extraordinary period of creative fertility that followed in the wake of his reunion with Clara Wieck, the sweetheart from whom he had been separated for many months. The year of song was far from idyllic; for much of it, Schumann had to contend with the litigation initiated by Clara's father, Friedrich, who was implacably opposed to their relationship. Implacable or not, he lost the battle, and on the 12th of September 1840, Clara Wieck became Clara Schumann. More than half of Schumann's output of lieder, much of it infused with his feelings for Clara, dates from this single year, including one of his finest song-cycles, Dichterliebe - The Poet's Love. Right at the other end of the spectrum are the 5 Hunting Songs of 1849, for male chorus and a quartet of horns.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b037vyy9_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037vyy9.html|2|1|

In the last few months, another terrible gang rape hit the headlines. Women's collectives are growing up all over the country and beginning to fight back. The most prominent and potent is the Pink Sari Gang. This is their story.  Sampat Devi Pal, raised in India's Uttar Pradesh region, was married off at twelve, had her first child at fifteen, and is essentially illiterate. Yet she has risen to become the fierce and courageous founder and commander in chief of India's Pink Gang, a 20,000-member women's vigilante group fighting for the rights of women in India.  In narrating the riveting story of the Pink Gang's work on behalf of a young girl unlawfully imprisoned at the hands of an abusive politician, journalist Amana Fontanella-Khan explores the origins and tactics of a fiery sisterhood that has grown to twice the size of the Irish army.  Merging courtroom drama, compelling personal history, and a triumphant portrait of grassroots organisation, Pink Sari Revolution highlights the extraordinary work of women who are shaking things up within their own country.  Amana is a Mumbai-based writer of Pakistani and Irish descent. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, The Financial Times and the FT magazine. An honorary gulabi member, this is her first book.   Episode 3 Sampat continues to investigate the case of Sheelu, whose harrowing story has now emerged.

In this 70th anniversary week of the programme, Donald Macleod explores the work and life of this prototypically Romantic composer, who drew his inspiration as much from literature and the dramas of his own life as from the music of the composers he revered - above all, Bach, Beethoven and Schubert.  Largely self-taught, Schumann immersed himself in one musical medium until he felt ready to move on and tackle another. So this week's programmes look in turn at his five major fields of compositional activity: solo piano; song; chamber music; music drama; and music for orchestra.  Schumann's first serious venture into chamber music came in 1842, and it was an exceptionally productive one: two piano quintets, three string quartets and a set of Phantasiestücke for piano trio. The first quintet is one of Schumann's most popular works and has a truly symphonic sweep. By contrast, the quartets are intimate and discursive. Ten years on, Schumann was half-way through an ill-fated post as Director of Music for the city of Düsseldorf. Perhaps it was the increasingly unsatisfactory nature of his encounters with the local symphony orchestra, of which he was now the conductor, that spurred him to an intense, late burst of chamber-music composition, including the strange and elliptical Märchenerzählungen.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b037vyyc_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037vyyc.html|3|1|

So this week's programmes look in turn at his five major fields of compositional activity: solo piano; song; chamber music; music drama; and music for orchestra.  Today's programme is largely devoted to Schumann's one and only opera, Genoveva, a tale of conjugal suspicion - and devotion - set in the time of the Crusades. It's been widely criticised for its lack of real drama, but contains some wonderful music and deserves to be better known. Schumann's other major dramatic project started off as an opera but metamorphosed into an oratorio; Scenes from Goethe's Faust kept its composer occupied, on and off, for nearly ten years. Like Genoveva, it's had a mixed reception critically, and is equally deserving of performance.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b037vyyf_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037vyyf.html|4|1|
